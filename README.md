# Bac sport

Bac sport is a web page that could be used to help generate the gymnastic choices page for the baccalaureate candidates.

It's almost a rewrite in HTML and JavaScript of the application of my friend __Nizar Dhifallah__, hosted at [kiteb.net](http://kiteb.net/education/bacsport/bac/gymnastique/fiche/)

A demo of this application can be reached here at [eb2a.com](http://bacsport.eb2a.com/).

The original application at [kiteb.net](http://kiteb.net/education/bacsport/bac/gymnastique/fiche/) generate PDF, this application consumes space to host __tcpdf__ files and make usage of extra CPU usage on the server to generate the PDF than stream it.

The new application is fully client side, the server is only required to serve the needed files.
